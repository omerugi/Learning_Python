    What do you think is the -type- of the variable "x" below?
    **Hint: it would be the same type no matter the input.

    x = input("type something: ")

    (1) str
    (2) int
    (3) none

    print("Second question:")
    '''
    Only after you answered the first question - check the type of "x" and print it.
    **Hint 1: There is in "main_2.py" a line of code that get the type of a variable. 
    **Hint 2: It's in the "try - except" code block.

    Write a simple program using everything we learned in lesson 2:
    Create 2 variables - one with your age, and one with your dad's age.
        * Example:
            x = 2
            y = 3
    add them together and keep the value in new variable and print this new variable.
        * Example: 
            x = 2
            y = 3
            new_var = x+y
            print(new_var)
     
    Then create a "try - except" block.
    In the try block add to "new_var" a variable from different type so we would get an error.
    Inside the except block print why we got an error.
        * Example:
            try:
                new_var + ??? # Fill in the missing code
            except:
                print(why we got an error)
    Rules:
    1. Give the variables good names.
        *Hint: Remember what we did in "main_2.py", check lines 55-56, names that have meaning.
    2. Use Typing like in "main_2.py" lines 110-113, what is the type of each variable.
    3. Add comments explaining the code- what do you store in each variable, what are you doing in the "try" code block.
